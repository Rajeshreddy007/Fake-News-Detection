This project aims to predict whether an article is real or fake by analyzing the relationship between its words. To accomplish this, we utilized the TFIDF Vectorizer model for building our predictive model. Our dataset consists of articles related to the 2016 US presidential election.
Moving forward, we plan to enhance our system by implementing web scraping techniques to gather data from various social media platforms and websites. This will allow us to obtain a wider range of articles to train and test our model. Additionally, we aim to improve the accuracy of our predictions
through query optimization Detecting fake news is a complex task that demands a multifaceted strategy. Although machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques can aid in detecting patterns and features that indicate fake news, they are not
sufficient on their own. Fake news can be intentionally crafted to deceive such algorithms. Therefore, supplementing these techniques with human expertise and critical thinking skills is critical. Additionally, educating people on how to identify and evaluate sources of information can help them become more
discerning news consumers. To effectively combat the spread of fake news, a combination of technological and human approaches will be required.
